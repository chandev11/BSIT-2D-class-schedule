          I am a self-made Programmer, driven by a passion for creating seamless
          and innovative digital experiences. My journey began with a curiosity
          for technology, and now I specialize in building scalable applications
          from front to back. From responsive design to server-side logic, I
          thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning new
          technologies. Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces or
          optimizing backend systems, coding is more than a skill, it's a part
          of who I am.
